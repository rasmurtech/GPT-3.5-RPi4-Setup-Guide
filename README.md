# GPT-3-RPi4-Setup-Guide
This repository provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to setting up and using OpenAI's GPT-3 API on a Raspberry Pi 4.

 ## Pre-requisites
A working Raspberry Pi 4 with internet access.
A Python version 3.6 or higher installed on the Raspberry Pi.
An API key from OpenAI. Note that as of September 2021, the usage of the API is not free and you need to comply with OpenAI's use-case policy.

## Instructions
Check your Python version

Open a terminal window and type:

css
Copy code
python3 --version
If your version is below 3.6, you need to upgrade Python.

Install pip

Pip is a package manager for Python. You can use it to install the necessary libraries. To install pip, open a terminal window and type:

sql
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip
Set up a virtual environment (Optional, but recommended)

A virtual environment is a way to keep the dependencies for your project separate from other projects. To create a virtual environment, first install the virtualenv package:

Copy code
pip3 install virtualenv
Then, navigate to your project directory and create a new virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
cd your_project_directory
virtualenv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install the OpenAI Python client

Install the OpenAI Python client using pip. This will allow you to make requests to the GPT-3 API:

Copy code
pip3 install openai
Get your API Key

To use the GPT-3 API, you need an API key from OpenAI. You can get this from the OpenAI website.

Use the API

Now you're ready to use the GPT-3 API! You can use the following Python code as a starting point:

python
Copy code

import openai

# Set up the OpenAI API client
openai.api_key = ""  # Replace 'your-api-key' with your actual API key

def generate_response(prompt, model="text-davinci-002", n=1, max_tokens=150, temperature=0.5):
    completions = openai.Completion.create(
        engine=model,
        prompt=prompt,
        n=n,
        max_tokens=max_tokens,
        temperature=temperature,
    )
    response = completions.choices[0].text.strip()
    return response

def chatbot(prompt):
    user_prompt = f"User: {prompt}\nAI:"
    response = generate_response(user_prompt)
    return response

if __name__ == "__main__":
    while True:
        user_input = input("User: ")
        if user_input.lower() in ["exit", "quit"]:
            break
        response = chatbot(user_input)
        print(f"AI: {response}")

## Note
Remember to handle exceptions and errors properly in your production-level code. Also keep in mind that the usage of the API costs money, and there's a limit to how many tokens (chunks of text) you can process in one request.

Use the GPT-3 responsibly and follow OpenAI's use case policy and guidelines.
